# Fake-News-analysis

## Introduction

This data analysis project focuses on a fake-real news dataset, with the primary goal of training a classifier to distinguish between fake and real news articles. The main research questions addressed include analyzing the target label distribution, identifying important features for prediction, creating a heuristic rule for a baseline model, and assessing the sufficiency of data for training a well-performing classifier.

## Summary

The project aims to train a fake news classifier through a thorough analysis of a fake-real news dataset. Key findings include a balanced target distribution, identification, and removal of data leakages, and the development of a heuristic model achieving an accuracy of 0.792 and an F1-score of 0.791. Final model demonstrated high accuracy (0.997) and F1-score (0.997).
